# Comprehensive Financial Market Analysis: Static and Streaming Data

This repository hosts two Jupyter notebooks, `static_data.ipynb` and `streaming_data.ipynb`, designed for comprehensive financial market analysis using both static and live streaming data. These notebooks employ advanced techniques, such as Bollinger Bands and Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), to offer deep insights into stock trends, market behaviors, and trading strategies, complete with actionable buy, sell, hold, and alert signals.

## Notebooks Overview

### Static Data Analysis (`static_data.ipynb`)

Focuses on the analysis of historical financial data to extract meaningful insights and trends. It includes detailed explorations of Bollinger Bands and VWAP for static market data, providing a solid foundation for understanding stock movements and volatility. This notebook is perfect for in-depth market research and historical trend analysis.

Key Features:
- Data preparation and transformation for analysis.
- Sliding window analysis for computing statistical summaries.
- Generating buy, sell, and hodl signals based on historical data.
- Visualizations including Bollinger Bands and VWAP to illustrate market trends.

### Real-Time Data Analysis (`streaming_data.ipynb`)

Designed for live market data analysis, this notebook offers tools to process and visualize data in real-time. It supports live data streaming and interactive visualizations, enabling users to monitor market trends and make informed trading decisions on the fly.

Key Features:
- Integration with live financial ticker data for real-time analysis.
- Application of Bollinger Bands and VWAP in a streaming context.
- Real-time generation of buy, sell, and hodl alerts.
- Dynamic and interactive data visualizations to track market movements.

## Data

The analysis in both notebooks is exemplified using `ticker.csv`, a dataset containing sample financial market data. This CSV file provides a practical basis for demonstrating the analysis techniques and generating trading signals.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to access the notebooks and the `ticker.csv` data file.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, along with required Python packages such as Pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Bokeh.
3. Launch the desired notebook in Jupyter and follow the instructions within to perform the analysis.
